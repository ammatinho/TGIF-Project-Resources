# { TRANSPARENT GOVERNMENT } 

NOTE: If live data is not loading, API key might have expired!!!!!

Created a Congressional tracking web site for Transparent Government in Fact (TGIF), a non-partisan non-profit 
organisation working to increase the publicâ€™s involvement in government.

Steps of the process:

- Obtained API key for the ProPublica Congress API and the JSON objects for the two chambers of Congress
- Created HTML pages that use JavaScript to display the JSON data 
- Added filters by 3 party checkboxes - Democrats, Republicans, Independents 
- Added drop-down menu 
- Calculate the statistics and algorithms in Javascript

Technologies used:

< JavaScript and JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery and Vue JS AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) 
to communicate directly with web services from a web page JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) 
RESTful (Representational State Transfer) APIs (Application Program Interfaces) to standardize the messages
used to get JSON objects with AJAX calls />
